1. Structured, Unstructured data
2. Source of data
3. Outliers
4. Visualization tools 
5. 2009/2011 --> a term called data science, 
                  before that it was called statistics.

People come from different background and 
end up in data science. 
Cohort background (many paths to data science)
Singer -> Doctor -> Data Science or work with data
6. Characteristics of a data scientist
      curious, argumentative, judgemental, 
      ability to tell a story, comfort level, 
      competetitive advantage --> some domain expertise
      acquire analytical skills
7. Course Text Book: 
'Getting Started with Data Science' Publisher:
IBM Press; 1 edition (Dec 13 2015) Print.
Author: Murtaza Haider
8. Discover optimum solutions to problems 
Example: Uber collects data to place right driver at 
          right position, right place, right etc. 
         Focusing on big data analysis.
9. Tools to deal with these data 
10. Develop new algorithmic models 
11. Interdiciplinary training
    --> collect, cleaning, analysizing, tools, data strategy, 
    case studies, data strategy, ML models, efficient solution
12. Favourite topics from the cohort 
    -> Regression, Visualization, ANN, behaviour in algorithms 
        Nearest Neighbour, Visualization. 
13. Structured data versus Unstructured data 
14. Time, Distance, Base fair versus Actual fair 
    --> Regression helps to understand the constant (base), 
        relationship between time+pay and distance+pay. 
15. Cloud for data science 
    --> bypass the physical limitations of the system. 
    --> multiple entitiies work at the same time, same data 
    --> access to open-source tools such as Apache
    --> increases productivity for data scientists
16. IBM developer skills network provides 
17. Data science versus Statistics, Role of big data
